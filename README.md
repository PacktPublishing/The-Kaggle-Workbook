## Getting started



You can run these notebooks on cloud platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or your local machine. Note that most chapters require a GPU even TPU sometimes to run in a reasonable amount of time, so we recommend one of the cloud platforms as they come pre-installed with CUDA.



### Running on a cloud platform


To run these notebooks on a cloud platform, just click on one of the badges (Colab or Kaggle) in the table below. The code will be reproduced from Github directly onto the choosen platform (you may have to add the necessary data before running it). Alternatively, we also provide links to the fully working original notebook on Kaggle that you can copy and immediately run.

## Book description
More than 80,000 Kaggle novices currently participate in Kaggle competitions. To help them navigate the often-overwhelming world of Kaggle, two Grandmasters put their heads together to write The Kaggle Book. The first guidebook on techniques for success has since made plenty of waves in the community. Now, they’ve come back with an even more practical approach based on hands-on exercises that can help you start thinking like an experienced data scientist.

In this book, you’ll get up close and personal with four extensive case studies based on past Kaggle competitions. You’ll:

* Learn how bright minds predicted which drivers would likely avoid filing insurance claims in Brazil

* See how expert Kagglers estimated the uncertainty distribution of Walmart unit sales

* Discover the different solutions on how to identify the type of disease present on cassava leaves that were discovered in 2021

* Learn how the Kaggle community classified detected toxic content on Quora with NLP

You can use this workbook as a supplement alongside the Kaggle Book or on its own alongside resources available on the Kaggle website and other online communities. Whatever path you choose, this workbook will help make you a formidable Kaggle competitor.

## What you will learn
* Boost your data science skillset with a curated selection of exercises
* Combine different methods to create better solutions
* Case studies and exercises to take your data modeling skills further
* Get a deeper insight into NLP and how it can help you solve unlikely challenges
* Sharpen your knowledge of time-series forecasting
* Challenge yourself to become a better data scientist

## Who this book is for
If you’re new to Kaggle and want to sink your teeth into practical exercises, start with The Kaggle Book, first. A basic understanding of the Kaggle platform, along with knowledge of machine learning and data science is a prerequisite.

This book is suitable for anyone starting their Kaggle journey or veterans trying to get better at it. Data analysts/scientists who want to do better in Kaggle competitions and secure jobs with tech giants will find this book helpful.
